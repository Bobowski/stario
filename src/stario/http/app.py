"""
Application object: route table plus shutdown-aware tasks.

The HTTP protocol does not call this class per request. It reads the compiled
trie (`compiled()`) and constructs `asyncio.Task(handler(c, w))`, registering
incomplete tasks on `app.tasks` for shutdown drain. `create_task` puts app
background work on that same set. `TestClient` drives the protocol too, so
there is one dispatch path.
