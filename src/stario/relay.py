"""Tiny process-local pub/sub for dotted subjects and prefix wildcards.

- `publish` is synchronous and thread-safe — safe from worker threads, asyncio
  tasks, or sync code on the loop thread
- subscriptions bind to the asyncio loop that registered them; consume only there
- not a broker: no cross-process delivery, durability, replay, or global ordering
- use NATS, Redis, or another broker when you need multiprocess fanout or
  backpressure policy

**Subjects** (publish): exact, non-empty dotted strings — no wildcards.

**Patterns** (subscribe): exact subject, trailing `prefix.*`, or `*`.

**Threading**: `Relay.lock` protects the subscriber registry. Each subscription
has an `_inbox_lock` guarding its pending queue and waiter future so a worker
thread can `publish` while a handler awaits the next message on the owning loop.
Cross-loop delivery always uses `loop.call_soon_threadsafe`.

`RelaySubscription` is an opaque handle — enter with `async with`, then
consume with `receive()` or `async for`.
